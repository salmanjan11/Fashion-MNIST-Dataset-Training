# Fashion-MNIST-Dataset-Training
## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER ! ⚠️
This is not a professional code
It basically trains a Neural Network to identify clothes from the Fashion MNIST Dataset. 

## That being said, if it can help you, feel free to use it!

To execute it in a simple way, you just have to build the dockerfile with ```docker build -t afancyname /path/to/your/project/docker```. 
Then you can run it with ```docker run -it -v /path/to/your/project/:/app --rm afancyname```.
Run it a first time to generate a model and then a second one to test it.
